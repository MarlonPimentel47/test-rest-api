# Simple RESTful API

After following several tutorials and videos, I made my own small restful API in order to solidy my understanding. I utilized the library Flask-RESTful which made the process a lot quicker.

To test the API endpoints (to see if the responses were working as they should be), I used a useful tool called Postman.
